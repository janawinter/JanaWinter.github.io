  <p> <strong> Technical Blog Part 1 </strong>

<p> As an aspiring developer I feel like I am constantly blocked on simple problems.Its a constant battle that leads to many frustrations, and many rabbit holes-  but then with that also comes some beautiful moments of clarity....

I had a few issues this week with the FizzBuzz exercise- trying to figure out how to return the numbers not just a whole lot of Fizz / Buzz or FizzBuzzes..
This is how I have solved a problem in an elegant way- using various techniques.
What I usually do is go through what I call an 'idiot check'- and check all the spelling, the brackets, semi colons, camelCase and punctuation first.
I'm not sure if that is exactly elegant- but it is usually the way I go about it.
I had to go through step by step and over all the material to figure out how to return what I wanted. I googled and went over other resources.   I also talked it through with my partner out loud trying and this helped, when you're forced to put something into words it can really  make you think and often figure it out ( the Rubber Ducky technique)
I learnt that the best way to trouble shoot is that to first find where the problem lies, so break it down bit by bit, trial and error, using console.log to figure it out each step-  then in doing so, gaining a deeper understanding of what exactly it us I want to do and therefore how to execute it the next line.  I used the console in dev tools error messages to figure out where I was going wrong and on what line the error was on. This was very helpful with trial and error.

      <p> <strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong>

    </p>
   <p>
     <strong> Pseudocode:-</strong> I use this all the time, when I'm given a question I pseudocode it straight away then work out the syntax
      <br>
    <strong> Trying something:-</strong>I'm always trying something!
     <br>
    <strong> Rubber ducky method:-</strong> I do this- but I don't necessarily talk to a rubber ducky, I say things out loud, or talk to someone about them.
     <br>
    <strong> Reading error messages:-</strong> I definitely like to read error messages as they often identify the problem ( Except code academy) I love how DevTools gives you the exact line the error is on.
     <br>
     <strong>Console.logging:-</strong> This is a great way to check out coding exercised and making sure they work!
     <br>
   <strong> Googling:-</strong> Googling is my best friend.
    <br>
   <strong> Asking your peers for help.-</strong> I am comfortable asking my supportive peers for help:- however I usually find the answers in the above before I get that stage.
    <br>
    <strong> Asking coaches for help:-</strong> I am happy asking my coaches for help if applicable.
     <br>
   <strong> Improving your process with reflection:-</strong> Definitely, how else does one learn from their mistakes! Its important to reflect on your work, or your week and see the areas that need improving or to feel good about achievements.

    <strong>Part 2: Explain these functions</strong>
      </p>
    <p>

   <strong> .map( )</strong>
Creates a new array from the result of the function of your first array. It is similar to a loop but only uses the

     I think the best example is the one on w3schools website:

  <code>var numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25];
 function myFunction() { x = document.getElementById("demo")x.innerHTML = numbers.map(Math.sqrt);}
   The result will be:
   2,3,4,5
   </code>
   </p>
<br>
<p><strong>.filter( ) </strong>
</p>
 Returns an array from the provided function by filtering the result to only what you ask it.
another example from  w3schools website:
<code>var ages = [32, 33, 16, 40];
function checkAdult(age) {return age >= 18;}
function myFunction() {document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = ages.filter(checkAdult);}
</code>

</p>
<br>

<p><strong>.reduce( ) </strong>

Reduces an array to a single result from the function you have called. It goes through your array or your variables and combines them into one string- does the math, I see it as a kind of stripping back of an array, resulting in only
Another. Here is an example from developer.mozilla.org


<code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(function(previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array) {return previousValue + currentValue;
});
</code>
