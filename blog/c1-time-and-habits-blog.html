    <h1>Time and habits</h1>

    <h2> A timebox of 'time and habits' resources</h2>


    <h3>20th May 2016</h3>

    <p>

    <ul>
   <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
   </li>
    </ul>

    </p> 

<p>
     I haven’t tried anything yet- but I found the 'tiny habits' technique interesting, and would like to give that a go.

    <ul>
      <li>what did you find interesting?</li>
    </ul>  
    The article about  having to prove to yourself that you can achieve things, in order to be confident about it struck a cord with me. I feel this has definitely been evident for me this week. Once I prove that I can work things out, the whole course seems far more achieveable!

    <p> <ul>
      <li> what worked for you?</li>
    </ul>
    Well considering I time boxed the reading I feel that that method worked for me, as I was fully focussed and dedicated for the entire hour to that task,(no small feat for someone who is easily distracted)
    </p> 

    <p> 
   <ul>
     <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
   </ul>
   
    I would like to try meditation, as one of the writers mentioned, it doesn’t’ have to be traditional meditation, it could be just sitting in a peaceful place with a beautiful view, or going for a walk, I am going to try and be more mindful of these practises and make a conscious effort to do more of them. Perhaps even delving into traditional meditation.
