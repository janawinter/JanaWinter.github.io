    <h1>Time and habits</h1>

    <h2> A timebox of 'time and habits' resources</h2>

<h3> 19th May 2016 </h3>

<p>
   <strong> Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </strong>
 </p>

<br>
<p>
  I haven’t tried anything yet-but I found the 'tiny habits' technique interesting, and would like to give that a go.
 </p>

<p>
 <strong> what did you find interesting?</strong>
</p>

<br>
<p>
    The article about  having to prove to yourself that you can achieve things, in order to be confident about it struck a cord with me. I feel this has definitely been evident for me this week. Once I prove that I can work things out, the whole course seems far more achieveable!
  </p>
  <br>
<p>
   <strong> what worked for you?</strong>
 </p>
     <br>
    Well considering I time boxed the reading I feel that that method worked for me, as I was fully focussed and dedicated for the entire hour to that task,(no small feat for someone who is easily distracted)
    </p>
 <br>
<p>
   <strong> Which will you experiment further with? </strong>
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>
   I would like to try meditation, as one of the writers mentioned, it doesn’t’ have to be traditional meditation, it could be just sitting in a peaceful place with a beautiful view, or going for a walk, I am going to try and be more mindful of these practises and make a conscious effort to do more of them. Perhaps even delving into traditional meditation.
