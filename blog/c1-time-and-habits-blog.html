    • Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
   
     I haven’t tried anything yet- but I found the 'tiny habits' technique interesting, and would like to give that a go.

    <p>What did you find interesting? 
    The article about  having to prove to yourself that you can achieve things, in order to be confident about it struck a cord with me. I feel this has definitely been evident for me this week. Once I prove that I can work things out, the whole course seems far more achieveable! w

    <p>
    What worked for you?
    
     Well considering I time boxed the reading I feel that that method worked for me, as I was fully focussed and dedicated for the entire hour to that task,(no small feat for someone who is easily distracted)

      </p>

    
    <p> Which will you experiment further with?
   
    I would like to try meditation, as one of the writers mentioned, it doesn’t’ have to be traditional meditation, it could be just sitting in a peaceful place with a beautiful view, or going for a walk, I am going to try and be more mindful of these practises and make a conscious effort to do more of them. Perhaps even delving into traditional meditation.
