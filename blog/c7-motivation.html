<h4>"Delivering happiness"</h4>

    <p> <strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? </strong></p>

<p>The Pleasure, Passion Purpose lens is how we experience each of these and what brings us most happiness. I think how they described it was accurate to how most people live their lives.
 The first P is <strong> Pleasure</strong> Most people seek out and want pleasure the first, which is often short lived and unsustainable. It has been said that in order to be successful and have fulfilled happpiness you must do the things in life that are most sustainable, so unfortunately as pleasure does not last long, it is the least sustainable.

The next P is <strong>Passion</strong>, this is described as flow, where this is both effective and enjoyable and therefore things just flow.. and time flies by.
 The most sustainable of all is<strong> Purpose</strong>. In order to feel completely satisfied and happy in life you need to have a higher purpose, something that is much bigger than you.</p>
<br>
 <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose exercise</strong>
 <br>
<strong>My core values are:</strong>
Respect, Integrity, Love.
<br>
<strong>I stand for:</strong>
Equality, human rights, fairness, sustainability, kindness, world peace.
<br>
<p> <strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></p>

<strong>Resilience:</strong>

<strong>Inner calm</strong> The foundation of resilience - Bring your mind to a place that is clear and calm i.e mindfulness

<strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> Recognition that success and failure are both emotional experiences

<strong>cognitive resilience</strong> creating conditions for optimism
<br>

<strong>Meditation Exercise:</strong>
I found returning to a failure one pretty stressful as I didnâ€™t want to go there again, however I think I managed to overcome those feelings and no longer think of them with adversity.
Returning to success was obviously a lot easier in dealing with those feelings..
<br>
<strong>Any other musings?</strong>


I liked the Nathan Myhrvold quote and how basically you have to feel dumb and confused in order to be creative and achieve great things.
