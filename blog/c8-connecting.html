<p><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></p>
<p>
 I like to think of myself as someone who reads people well and with ease. I can tell straight away if someone is genuine or or sincere by their body language, the way they hold themselves and the tone of their voice.
I am constantly testing new people to see whether I can gain trust, and I can tell pretty fast if I can or not.
I immediately take a step back from the person if I can no longer trust them, or if I can trust them I let in pretty quick as I  am very open person, and I don’t let people in easily.
I guess a good example of this would be for example would be TradeMe. Its amazing the level of trust that some people place on the buyers or the sellers really, Trademe must have really good scam filters, or NZers must just be really open and trustworthy people. For example: Pick ups. There is not many places in the world where I can think of that you often have someones email adders, phone number, bank acc details, and then physical address if you want to pick up!
That to me is crazy!</p>


<p><strong> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></p>
<p>Empathy:</p>

Empathy is a skill that for all the social competencies

-Understanding others
-Developing others
-Political awareness.

<p>
I would say this is always how I listen to people. I think its pretty rude if someone is not caring about what the person talking to them is saying..

I did the exercise with my partner and I talked about how I was feeling about EDA and bootcamp about to start.
I felt like it was rather distressing talking to her about it as she is a developer and wants me to do well, and my fear is that I am not feeling confident with the material therefore anxious about the course.
When it was my turn to listen to her she told about her problems with one of her business partners being an alpha male and never listening to her and in this case, ignoring her suggestions, then claiming them as his later on.

The meta conversation just involved us comforting each other basically.</p>

<p> <strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></p>

<p>I found myself smiling, so its effective!!</p>

<p> <strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></p>

<p>
I did this out loud to myself, I found it pretty strange to be honest, to be saying a monologue I already knew of. But it was interesting to see the points from the other side, I did find it hard to be completely convinced of their side of things.. haha</p>

<p><strong> Any other musings?</strong></p>
<p>
This book is starting to really feel like it is recycling a lot of old concepts but giving them a new name… repeating itself a lot, or maybe the concepts/exercises are just similar..hmmm..
