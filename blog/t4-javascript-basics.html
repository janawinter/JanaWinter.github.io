        <p> <strong> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong>

      Javascript is a programming language thats main purpose is to process and manipulate data input, by performing more complex functions in its output - it can create super duper visual effects, or process complex calculations and functions of your data.
       HTML is your basic content language, and CSS is your styling for that HTML.- I.e how you want it displayed on the page, - If you want anything more than that- I.e pretty much a static page-  then you’ll need Javascript

      <p> <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong>

      Loops are used to scan through your data on repeat. Going with the control flow - Loops can search for, update, replace add to and delete your data.
      Everyday examples of this would be like your morning routine, wake up, feed cats, have a shower, make coffee, eat breakfast. etc, all repetitive stuff you do every day- or your control flow.
      The loops would be things like assessing, “What am I going to wear today? going through your wardrobe and drawers” or “What shall I have for breakfast? “where you have to look and see what is available to you and do accordingly- these would be your loop.

      <strong> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.
</strong>
    Arrays are set out in sequential order from index zero, so when you want to access any part of an array, you start off counting from the numerical zero.
    Objects contain a key and a property- and you can create and access them via two ways: using literals or constructors.
</p>

      <p>
      <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong>
      </p>

      A function is something that you can make the computer do over and over automatically rather than having to manually do it yourself, where you can change the inputs but the function remains the same. There is a saying here “DRY” - Don’t Repeat Yourself- Use a function instead!
