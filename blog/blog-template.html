        <p> <strong> How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong>

      I find it hard to not focus on the design (I still am working on it!) But the concept really made me just focus to get the pages functioning right and fully responsive, instead of worrying about the overall look- I think that these two almost work together- the website design and responsive design. I feel like I will be spending a bit more time of the look of the site over the next while.

      <p> <strong>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</strong>

      I guess most of my life I thought meditation was something one did for a very long time- I.e an hour or more at a time.
      I thought it was predominantly for spiritual hippy people and not for people like Meng who work at google, or for the students that go through EDA to learn.

      <strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      That it doesn’t have to be done the traditional way, one can generally do their own style, in their own way, however is most comfortable, and wherever you want to do it.

      That it is good for us both emotionally and physically, it can help with all sorts of stresses and even physical medical conditions.

      <strong>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
      I liked the “Imagine you’re a mountain” when meditating, and also
      <br>

      <p> <strong> Any other musings?</strong></p>

      “Breathing as though your life depended on it is pretty good way of looking at it.
