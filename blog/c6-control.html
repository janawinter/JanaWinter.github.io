        <p> <strong> Triggers and 'SBNR' - Siberian North Rail Road </strong>
<br>
  <p> "One way of looking at the Siberian North Railroad approach is as an emotional self-regulation strategy, starting with attentional control and resulting in cognitive change over time"

  Excerpt From: Tan, Chade-Meng. "Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace)." iBooks. </p>


   <p> <strong>  How did you find the Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond technique? </strong>
<br>

  <p>
  From the reading, its proven that this is defintely a great tecnique to tackle challenging situations. Stop, Breath,Notice, Reflect and Respond. Its self explanatory, but often hard to exercise when you're in the midst of a challenging situation!
  I think I already incorporate some of these techniques usually in life, and practise patience and empathy, but I did use it and found it to be helpful in dealing with some issues I was having with Javascript aka Minesweeper!  </p>
 <br>

  <p> <strong>What are some of my triggers? What causes a disproportionately large emotional response?</strong> </p>
  </br>
  <p>
  "Triggers are also very often connected to a perceived inadequacy about ourselves that is a source of pain to us, sort of like a raw nerve." Excerpt From: Tan, Chade-Meng. "Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace)." iBooks.

  When programming, I think some triggers for me would definitely be feelings of low self confidence, when struggling with a new concept or language and not being able to full understand it makes me feel like I am not smart enough for it, do being down on myself. If I get faced with a challenge or feeling well over my head these negative emotions are defintitely triggered.

  Another trigger would be when something isn't working and I can't understand why, or figure out how to fix it, this is very frustrating! This week with minesweeper I had some difficulty for a long time with an unrelated browser issue,  it was driving me crazy not knowing why it wasn't working, doing everything I could to check and de-bug my code,  and then it was something completely unrelated and to do with the js lib file and my browser nto supporting it...This was veryfrustrating! however I'm going to have to get used to this as small things like this seem to happen all the time!  Ans using SNBRR is a great technique to get used to and start using it now! Haha...
