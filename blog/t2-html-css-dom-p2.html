<strong>What is grid based design?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Basically every website you look at is designed within a grid. Grid design is achieved by dividing up the page into columns and rows which creates a grid that you can then place the different elements you want to display around the page. For ease of division, there are usually no more than 12 columns on a page.

<strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages? </strong>
<br>
<p>
Responsive webpages are a way to view any webpage on any device without missing bits of information or having to scroll around the page to find the right content. A responsive webpage will either condense or expand appropriately whilst keeping the design looking good and all the information  visible. With all the vast options of media devices these days and smartphone technology, responsive website are indeed all the hype.

<strong> What is semantic structure?</strong>
<br>
<p>
Semantic structure is the use of html elements that actually has meaning to the untrained eye, where the word actually is the action. Rather than using other html code language such as div-  which is not a word or means nothing to most people, semantic structures are words like form or table.

 <p>I liked the place-kitten website, that was a cool demonstration. It was great to know how you add download fonts also.
 The @media queries were something  I think I need to explore more. </p>
