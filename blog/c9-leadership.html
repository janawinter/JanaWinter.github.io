      <p> <strong>  What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong>
      <p> I have not really experienced compassionate leadership, as my previous employment has been hospitality as a chef for around 8 years, then I studied and worked in audio engineering.
      With cooking you always have stressed out and crazy bosses, that order you around and treat you like dirt. With audio engineering you work for  your clients or you work with very serious people trying to get their work done well.  I would love to see/ experience compassionate leadership!  </p>

      <p><strong> Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>
      <p> It was interesting, to try and give goodness to all, I guess I just wished that I could give everyone goodness. </p>
       <br>
      <p> <strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>
       <p>
      It was quite relieving for me, when I was doing it for myself, when I had to do it for someone else it made me upset, but I tried to breathe through with it and managed to feel better and to feel better about them in their situation.</p>

      <p><strong> How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?<p> </strong>
      <p><strong>"Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness."</strong></p>
      <p>I can't say I can relate much of this to phase 0-from the readings, I see no correlation to be honest..</p>
      <p><strong> Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</p></strong>
      <p> I have had to do this is the past, it is often very hard to do, you have to skillfully manage the conversation and facilitate the outcome through what you say and how they are relating to it. </p>
      <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>
      <p> I am tired, other than that, here are some key points:
      ompassionate leadership can bring out the best in all
      Meditation on multiplying goodness
      Difficult conversations content feelings and Identity
      Influence - know self, understand others, serve the greater good </p>
