        <p> <strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
 </strong>

    I found it rather difficult at first, trying to stay focussed on what I was saying for the full 3   minutes. It was kind of nice but also kind of weird to just talk at someone for 3 minutes.
    ,When my partner did her 3 minutes I gave her my full attention- she struggled to find the words to speak for 3 minutes as she is generally not a talker-
      </p>
        <br>
      <p> <strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
</strong> </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      <strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      I would like to try to integrate more mindfulness in different ways, whilst doing everyday things, being more aware of them.  </p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p> <strong> Any other musings?</strong></p>

      I do like the humour in the book quite a lot, its a great read!
