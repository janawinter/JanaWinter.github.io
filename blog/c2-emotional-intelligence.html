  <p> <strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong>
  </p>
   <p>
   Emotional intelligence is almost as important as intellectual intelligence when it comes to being a great engineer. It is a really important quality for your work and your organisation. Anyone can be trained to increase emotional intelligence through the art of mindfulness. Mindfulness is about being in the present moment, an being fully aware, coming from a place of non judgement.
   Emotions are both in the brain and in the body, so listen to your body.

<strong> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </strong>
  </p>
   <p>
    I thought it was quite a revelation- I was focussing on my breathing and it was rather surreal and also calming. Ididn't realise simple breathing could produce such sense of calm. Its something I want to keep trying in future.
