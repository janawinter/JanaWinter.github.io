        <p> <strong> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important? </strong>
  </p>
      A Responsive site is a site that still looks good when seen on an iPhone, an iPad or a desktop computer. Before responsive sites, everything would stay the same size, but the window would get smaller and you’d have to scroll left to right to see it properly. Responsive design works so that everything on the site will shrink with the window size and will still look good.

      <p> <strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mobile first design is when you design for mobile first, as it says, you start designing making sure the mobile view looks great first, then you work up from there, to tablet, and then desktop. It is important so instead of the design degrading as the size gets smaller, it rather expands and still looks good as the screen gets bigger.

      <strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons? </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
Frameworks are pre written CSS files that you integrate into your webpage, so you don’t have to write every single element out.
The Pro of this is that they save you time as most f the groundwork is done, and you make your own personal changes.
The Con is that if  there is an element you want to change, its a bit more difficult and you have to go into the bones of the framework to change it.

      <strong> What a wireframe is and why we use it.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
     A wireframe is a mock up of a site, it is either sketched out by hand, or there are fancy programs that can draw them up, either way is acceptable, it is just a guide for you to plot out the look and layout of the website.
</p>
      <br>

      <p> <strong> Here are my expample wireframes. </strong></p>

       <div class="container">
            <div class="bottom-images">
           <IMG class="three columns" src="http://janawinter.github.io/images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="..."> </IMG>
            <IMG class="three columns" src="http://janawinter.github.io/images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="..."> </IMG>
             <IMG class="three columns" src="http://janawinter.github.io/images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="..."> </IMG>
             <IMG class="three columns" src="http://janawinter.github.io/images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="..."> </IMG>
          </div>
          </div>
          <br>

<p><strong>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</strong></p>
<p>
I found the placing of everything pretty difficult, and how to translate that in my main.css and to use the right html, I guess it was time to really excercise what we've been learning and it took me a while to translate that to page.
Once I understood the concepts a bit more I got there, but I think my media queries will take me a bit longer to get right.
