        <p> <strong>  What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness? </strong></p>
<br>
    <p>
      Mindfulness and self Awareness are the essentially the same principle- where when you are practising mindfulness you are also being fully self aware. It is  a state in which you are completely aware of your emotions, your body and your actions. Daniel Goleman defines self-awareness as "knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions."
    Here in an excerpt from the book on self awareness.
    <li>1.Emotional awareness: Recognising one's emotions and their effects.</li>
    <li>2.Accurate self-assessment: Knowing one's strengths and limits.</li>

   <li> 3.Self-confidence: A strong sense of one's self-worth and capabilities".</li>

    </p>
<br>
    <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </strong> </p>

    <p>I tried the body scan- I remember learning meditation when I was a kid and the body scan was the technique I remember- starting from the toes up.  I did this again tonight and found it deeply relaxing. I am really tired and this made me even more tired! but in a good way!

     </p>
        <br>
      <p> <strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>
    <p>
    My interpretation of that section was that through mindfulness one can take charge of their emotions so that instead of feeling anger and letting that mahe you an angry person, you can simply accept and acknowledge that emotion by saying I feel angry, rather than becoming it. Essentially you can take control of your emotions to be what you feel, and not what defines you as a person.
