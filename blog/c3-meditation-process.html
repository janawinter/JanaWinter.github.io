  <p> <strong>
      How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong>
      I think it just really made me want to get the pages functioning right and fully responsive, instead of worrying about the overall look- however, I feel like I will be spending a bit more time of the look of the site over the next while.

  <p> <strong>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</strong>
  I thought it was something that you did for a very long time- I. and hour or more.

I thought it was predominantly for spiritual hippy people and not for people like Meng who work at google.

<strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong>
  </p>
   <p>
   That it doesn’t have to be done the traditional way, one can generally do their own style, however is most comfortable.
That it is good for us both emotionally and physically, it can help with all sorts of stresses and conditions.

   <p>
<strong>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</strong>
  </p>
<p>
   I liked the “Imagine you’re a mountain” when meditating, and also
Any other musings?

“Breathing as though your life depended on it is pretty good way of looking at it.
