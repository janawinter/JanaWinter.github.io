      <h1>Reflections</h1>
      <h2>Cultural blog 1</h2>
      <h3>19th May 2016</h3>
  <p>
   From the first time I heard about EDA, I was really inspired to get involved. Not just to become a developer, but to be a part of a supportive and socially radical community.
  </p>

  <strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong>
   DBC and EDA seem to teach people something much bigger than just learning to code, and the onus is on us to learn, grow and develop what that is… Whatever we put in, is what that will become. its like we’re working on things in a completely holistic way, its a lifestyle, a cult, perhaps…? :D </p>
  <p><strong> What are your impressions?</strong>
 </p>
   <p>
    I love the emphasis both EDA and DBC have  on “soft skills” and core values being what determines your success in the program. I.e empathy, kindness and passion, is what I really love about it so far and what is most fundamentally important to me in life.
    So far everyone in the cohort has been really welcoming and helpful, this has really helped with the remote learning process and adjusting to the fast paced learning!
    </p>
 <p><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </strong>
  </p>
   <p>
    I have created the same environment for myself through my friends and family, we’re all very helpful and communicative and non judgemental, and I love having the knowledge that I can learn in same environment as this.  Having EDA ethos of being kind, supportive, progressive and inclusive in our cohort. I mean really - no one wants to try and learn alongside dicks? Its not very productive…
    </p>
   <p>
   <strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
   My expectations of EDA have changed a bit, in that I have realised that it is much more self/cohort directed than I thought. I guess I wasn’t sure of how the curriculum was going to be delivered, and I suppose I am used to the traditional educational methods of having one person telling us all what to do, and only having one way of doing it right. I’ve realised how much this is all about communicating when you’re vulnerable, or having trouble understanding the tasks, or feeling that you’re in way over your head,  reaching out to our cohort for help and also in helping others, and spending the time to work out problems through our available resources, things become achievable.  I’ve learnt over the past week that With EDA its all about working it through with the help of your cohort, you are not expected to understand something right away, you’re not dumb for not knowing something, and you are encouraged to ask questions and reach out to your peers for support!
   </p>
   <p>
  <strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong>
   </p>
   <p>
  I am excited to learn in this environment, I think its a really great way to learn - I.e all working on building this together. I do however have some apprehensions -I worry that certain barriers might make it a bit tricky for me to really feel completely comfortable I.e insecurities- about my abilities, about my learning pace, etc..
  I also worry that perhaps leaning on others- for some, might be a bit too much for them and make some resentful. I also feel like some people may not be on the same page as me, same ‘vibe’ as me, or may not take so well to the environment, causing difficulties for others. I hope this is not the case!
   </p>
   <p>
  All in all I am really looking forward to the challenges, set backs, mistakes, learning, lightbulb moments, plus personal and cohort triumphs that are about to unfold over the next 18 weeks.
