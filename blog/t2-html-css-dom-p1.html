<strong>
Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I think of a website as a structure built from many components: If you think about it as as house, you can break it down.  First you start with the bones of the house- the html, the foundations and structures of the building. When its time to look at the the interior, thats where we bring in CSS. Think of the CSS as the carpet, curtains, paint, colors, furniture etc. Javascript is the functions in which you interact with the house. Ie. how you open doors, the garage door opener etc.  The DOM s then architectural plans for the house, it will tell you how each component works, where it is and what you can add to it if you wish to make any renovations in future.

<strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong>
<br>
<p>
Boxifying Design is a concept that comes from the fact that everything on the internet is in boxes, well every element that we see, no matter what shape it is, is actually a box. Everything breaks down to an html element, and every html element is square. Boxifying design is a method many front end developers use when given a design from a designer, they will then go through the page and “boxify” it by drawing boxes around it to break down the components into elements. </p>

<p>
<strong> What is the box model?</strong>
<br>
<p>
As all html elements are actually boxes- The box model is the box that is made around each html element, shown in CSS as a box within a box, within a box etc-
It includes the margin, border, padding and content.</p>
